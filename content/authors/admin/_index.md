      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome! I’m a passionate researcher specializing in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and data-driven scientific discovery. My work explores ligand-metal interactions, molten salt chemistry, and free energy surface calculations using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs).

I combine molecular dynamics simulations, chemical informatics, and machine learning models to study complex chemical systems and predict material properties. I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of computational chemistry through innovative and collaborative research.

Thank you for visiting my site!
