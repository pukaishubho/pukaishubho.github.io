## About Me

Welcome! Iâ€™m a passionate researcher specializing in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and data-driven scientific discovery. My work explores ligand-metal interactions, molten salt chemistry, and free energy surface calculations using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs).

I combine molecular dynamics simulations, chemical informatics, and machine learning models to study complex chemical systems and predict material properties. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of computational chemistry through innovative and collaborative research.

Thank you for visiting my site!
